#Data Table with Sorting, Sticky Header, Sticky Column, and Horizontal Scroll

This repository contains a highly functional data table implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The table is equipped with powerful features like sorting columns, sticky header, sticky column, and previous/next buttons for horizontal scrolling. The logic has been implemented in plain and simple JavaScript, making it easily adaptable to other technologies such as Angular, React, Salesforce LWC, and more.

Features
Sorting Columns: You can effortlessly sort your data in ascending or descending order by clicking on the column headers. This feature enables better organization and quick access to relevant information.

Sticky Header: Say goodbye to scrolling frustrations! The table's header remains fixed at the top, allowing you to navigate through your data without losing sight of the column headers. This ensures easy reference to column names while exploring the dataset.

Sticky Column: Stay focused on specific data points even while scrolling horizontally. The data table keeps your chosen column in place, providing constant visibility and reducing the chances of losing track of important information.

Previous and Next for Horizontal Scroll: Navigating through extensive data has never been easier. The table allows you to scroll horizontally with ease, thanks to the convenient "previous" and "next" buttons. This enables swift movement across columns, enhancing user experience when dealing with wide datasets.
